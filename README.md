# challenge1 Refactor Horiseon webpage html and CSS

## Description

This purpose of this webpage was to further familiarize myself with proper html and css semantic structure. This project helped me to better understand how to spot and rewrite redundant code to produce more conscise and consolidated coding in CSS. This project also taught me how write comments in CSS which forced me to really deconstruct and understand what the code was doing. Having to describe what each class performed further enhanced my understanding of CSS code. Ultimately, I adhered to the Scout Rule which is to leave the code a little cleaner than when I found it.
